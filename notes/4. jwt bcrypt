user ke liye mongodb automatic unique id generate krta hai 
bson data me krta hai json me nahi


mongoose-aggregate-paginate 

aggregate se hi mongoose ko hi extra power milti hai, extra features use kr sakte hai

mongo aggregate pipeline, -> complex queries


both are based on cryptography, creates tokens
//bcrypt -> it helps you to hash your password

//jwt -> 

mongoose ke hooks -> middlewares


pre and post 

before saving or update data -> pre

after save or update -> post 

same as middleware hooks, methods bhi hai mongoose me
custom methods bhi design kr sakte

jwt is a bearer token, jiske bhi pass hai(jiske bhi pass chaabi hai) usko file de dege
