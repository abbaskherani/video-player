# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project appears to be a backend for a video sharing platform, similar to YouTube. It's built using Node.js with Express.js as the web framework and MongoDB as the database. The project uses various modern JavaScript features and follows a modular architecture.

## Key Components

### Models

1. **User Model**: Handles user data, authentication, and token generation.
2. **Video Model**: Manages video metadata and relationships.
3. **Comment Model**: Handles comments on videos.
4. **Like Model**: Manages likes on videos, comments, and tweets.
5. **Playlist Model**: Manages user-created playlists.
6. **Subscription Model**: Handles user subscriptions to channels.
7. **Tweet Model**: Manages tweet-like functionality.

### Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling the business logic of the application. Key controllers include:

- User Controller
- Video Controller
- Comment Controller
- Like Controller
- Playlist Controller
- Subscription Controller
- Tweet Controller
- Dashboard Controller

### Middleware

- **Auth Middleware**: Handles JWT verification for protected routes.
- **Multer Middleware**: Manages file uploads.

### Utilities

- **ApiError**: Custom error handling class.
- **ApiResponse**: Standardized API response format.
- **AsyncHandler**: Wrapper for async route handlers.
- **Cloudinary**: Handles file uploads to Cloudinary service.

## Key Features

1. User registration and authentication
2. Video upload and management
3. Commenting system
4. Like functionality for videos, comments, and tweets
5. Playlist creation and management
6. Subscription system
7. Tweet-like functionality
8. User dashboard with statistics

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Upload**: Multer and Cloudinary
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv
- **Development Tools**: nodemon, prettier

## Setup and Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration, stored in a `.env` file. A sample configuration is provided in `.env.sample`.

## API Structure

The API follows RESTful conventions and includes endpoints for user management, video operations, social features (likes, comments, subscriptions), and more.

## Error Handling

The project implements custom error handling with the `ApiError` class, allowing for consistent error responses across the API.

## File Upload

File uploads are handled using Multer for temporary storage and then transferred to Cloudinary for permanent storage and delivery.

## Database Interaction

MongoDB is used as the database, with Mongoose as the ODM. The project leverages Mongoose's features like schemas, models, and aggregate queries.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT is used for stateless authentication
- Environment variables are used for sensitive information

## Development Practices

- ESLint and Prettier are used for code formatting and style consistency
- Modular architecture for better code organization and maintainability
- Extensive use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations

This project provides a solid foundation for building a scalable and feature-rich video sharing platform backend.
